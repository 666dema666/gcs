	<p class=category>GURPS Character Sheet Release Notes</p>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.13 &mdash; January 31, 2007</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>There is now a preference (in the "Sheet" tab) that controls
				whether the standard method of calculating dice of damage is
				used, or the optional method from B269 is used.</li>
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913592&aid=1635546&group_id=185516">Feature #1635546</a>:
				Encumbrance not reflected in skills.</li>
			<li>Skills can now provide weapons.</li>
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913592&aid=1640629&group_id=185516">Feature #1640629</a>:
				Weaponmaster damage. Added the ability to specify weapon damage
				bonuses as a feature attached to an item. Note that the
				Weaponmaster advantage, if taken, will still need to be updated
				to reflect just which weapons it grants damage bonuses to.</li>
			<li>Added an option to specify the HTML template file to use when
				generating HTML from the command line.</li>
			<li>Added a preference to control which HTML template file is used
				by default.</li>
			<li>Partial implementation of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913592&aid=1641005&group_id=185516">Feature #1641005</a>:
				Support for enhancements and limitations. This feature is
				partially implemented in that you can now add enhancements and
				limitations to (dis)advantages... however there still needs to
				be support for creating stock versions and a way to easily
				select from them for application to a (dis)advantage. Thanks to
				Sebastien Wilhelmi for initial contributions in this area!</li>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913589&aid=1648935&group_id=185516">Bug #1648935</a>:
				DR drops to 1. This was actually a more fundamental screw-up on
				my part... when prepping the code for the initial open-source
				release, I somehow managed to mangle the leveled bonus class,
				which, in turn, mangled the data files.</li>
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913589&aid=1635547&group_id=185516">Bug #1635547</a>:
				Techniques do not drag-and-drop right.</li>
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913589&aid=1642308&group_id=185516">Bug #1642308</a>:
				Miscalculated defaults.</li>
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913589&aid=1646281&group_id=185516">Bug #1646281</a>:
				Items "slide off" weapon list.</li>
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913589&aid=1643782&group_id=185516">Bug #1643782</a>:
				Damage bonus due to high skill when kicking. Actually fixed by
				virtue of adding <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913592&aid=1640629&group_id=185516">Feature #1640629</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Data Files</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Due to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=913589&aid=1648935&group_id=185516">Bug #1648935</a>
				reverted the data files to their state as of the 3.1.0.11
				release, then tried to reinstate changes made since then.</li>
			<li>Updated the Boxing, Brawling, Karate, Judo, Climbing, Swimming
				&amp Stealth skills to use the new capabilities.</li>
			<li>Fixed various mathematics and navigation skill prerequisites.
				Contributed by Zachary St. Lawrence.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Miscellaneous</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated URLs used for the mailing lists to use the new
				SourceForge site.</li>
			<li>Added menu items to take users to the bug and feature trackers
				on SourceForge.</li>
			<li>Updated the version checker to use the new SourceForge site.</li>
			<li>Eliminated the "todo" docs, as I've created entries for them in
				the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=185516">SourceForge tracker system</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.12 &mdash; January 2, 2007</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Initial open-source release. GURPS Character Sheet is now
				licensed under the MPL
				(<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/</a>).</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Move can now be lowered to zero, but not by encumbrance (B17
				states that encumbrance can't lower it below 1). This allows a
				character with no legs to be created correctly.</li>
			<li>Minimum strength of weapons is now taken into account when
				calculating the skill level with that weapon.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Data Files</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Reworked the "Scroll" spell prerequisites to include native
				language as a possibility.</li>
			<li>Fixed the prerequisites on the "Teleport" spell.</li>
			<li>Removed the documentation that had previously been contributed
				as I was getting feedback that it wasn't useful.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.11 &mdash; September 24, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added support for advantage bonuses given to specifically named
				spells.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Changes to the custom browser command line are now actually
				saved and used.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Data Files</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated various skills that should have had defaults based on
				Perception rather than Will. Thanks to Scott Ellsworth, Jenny
				Ellsworth and Ashley Stroupe for discovering this and correcting
				it.</li>
			<li>Updated the prerequisites for Research to include Native
				Language.</li>
			<li>Added skills for languages when Language Talent is present,
				provided by Scott Ellsworth.</li>
			<li>Added some Banestorm-specific data files, provided by Scott
				Ellsworth.</li>
			<li>Updated the Magery advantages to take advantage of the new
				ability to give a bonus to a specific spell (in this case,
				Recover Energy). Updated by Scott Ellsworth.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.10 &mdash; September 2, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added an HTML output option. You can now use the "Save As..."
				menu item to save the sheet as HTML, PDF or PNG.  Likewise, the
				command line options have been updated to support generation of
				HTML from the command line.  The file 'template.html' in the
				'Data' directory controls the HTML output and may be modified
				by end users.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.9 &mdash; August 12, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added three new menu items to the Edit menu that control whether
				the various "natural" weapons show up on your character sheet.</li>
			<li>The carried equipment title now also summarizes the character's
				carried wealth as well as his carried weight.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the detail editor for Techniques from
				saving the difficulty.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that prevented correct redrawing of pages beyond the
				first when scrolled.  Most evident when trying to select items,
				as they would fail to highlight, even though they were in fact
				selected.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Data Files</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a variant of the skills list with categories, contributed
				by Sebastien Wilhelmi.</li>
			<li>Added some new undead meta-trait templates, contributed by
				Emmanuel Bachmann.</li>
			<li>Added a placeholder list (in that it only has a few items in it
				right now) for clerical magic, contributed by Jim O'Neil.</li>
			<li>Lots of mostly minor corrections to the various data lists,
				collected by emails sent to me and postings on the GCS mailing
				list.</li>
			<li>Added a spell list with all spells in it, categorized by
				college.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.8 &mdash; April 9, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Changed the default fonts &amp; font sizes to more closely
				match the platform's normal font choices. To see the difference,
				you may need reset the fonts in the font preference panel.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed an issue that prevented more than one feature from
				applying to any given thing.</li>
			<li>Fixed a problem which would prevent a sheet from being loaded if
				the system the sheet had been saved on didn't have a printer
				setup that GCS could detect.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.7 &mdash; April 2, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the ability specify skill specializations when specifying
				skill bonuses. Updated the four 'Absolute Direction' advantages,
				as well as 'Talent (Musical Ability)' accordingly.</li>
			<li>Added the Block stat to Melee Weapons, and updated the various
				weapons, shields &amp; cloaks appropriately.  If you want an
				item to display a Block stat, you just need to give it a melee
				weapon description (you can leave the actual weapon fields
				empty -- see 'Force Shield' as an example).</li>
			<li>Unspent points now automatically adjust as a character is
				modified. Changed the title 'Unspent' to 'Earned' in the points
				display to reflect that these represent earned but unspent
				points. This change means that a character's point total (which
				now includes the 'Earned' points, unlike in the past) won't
				change unless the user changes the 'Earned' points -- everything
				else just adjusts the 'Earned' points so that the total remains
				the same.</li>
			<li>Integer input fields now respond to the increment/decrement menu
				items.</li>
			<li>Implemented a minimalistic XML parser to drastically reduce the
				RAM requirements during file loads.</li>
			<li>Added a preference for controlling whether font anti-aliasing is
				used or not. Some systems (particularly those with older
				graphics cards) have drastically worse text rendering
				performance when this was turned on, so I've provided a way for
				you to turn it off if it is affecting you. Keep in mind that the
				smaller font sizes may be unreadable on the screen without this
				enabled, but they should still print fine.</li>
			<li>Added menu items for jumping to the GCS web site, as well as for
				jumping to the GCS mailing lists web site.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a problem which prevented the cost reduction feature from
				being restored from a saved file.</li>
			<li>Attempted to fix an issue on some platforms where a window could
				sometimes come to the foreground but not be the active window.</li>
			<li>Fixed some issues that were preventing the display from updating
				to display changes made via features.</li>
			<li>Fixed issue where case mattered in feature application.</li>
			<li>Fixed some more focus issues.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Data Files</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the 'Infinity Equipment' equipment list, contributed by
				Scott Ellsworth.</li>
			<li>Various minor tweaks to correct list data, sent in from various
				users.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.6 &mdash; March 5, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Spells can now have weapon descriptions attached to them, just
				like equipment and advantages.</li>
			<li>Added automatic update checking. The program will only notify
				you once for each update newer than the one you're running.
				There is also a menu item (under the Help menu) that shows the
				current status -- and, in the case where there is an update,
				will take you to the web site if you select it.</li>
			<li>The storage format for preferences has been changed to XML. A
				side effect of this is that your old preferences will be
				discarded and you'll have to set them again.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Data File Updates</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated all spells with weapon statistics, as needed. Contributed by
				Al Cardenas.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.5 &mdash; February 26, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added command line options to generate PDF and/or PNG files from
				sheet files without bringing up the user interface. In addition,
				options were added to override the paper size and margins for
				the generated files. For those of you running on a Mac, the
				actual executable is buried down inside the application bundle,
				so if you want to use this feature, you'll probably want to make
				a soft link or shell alias to it for convenience.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.4 &mdash; February 19, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the ability to modify the command keys associated with
				menu items. Check out the "Menu Keys" tab in preferences...</li>
			<li>Added direct PDF creation via the "Save As..." menu item.</li>
			<li>Separated the melee &amp; ranged weapon stats and gave each
				their own stat line in the weapon list. In addition, weapons
				that had more than one mode of operation (for example, a sword
				can be thrust or swung) now list the stats separately. For
				weapons like a Knife, whose skill values differ depending upon
				the mode of operation (melee or thrown), you can now specify
				separate defaults. Old weapon entries are converted as much as
				possible &mdash; you should carefully review any existing
				weapons on your character sheet and adjust them as needed.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Restored the automatic resolution of Damage, Range &amp; Parry
				in the weapon list. When I moved to the new list format, I
				ended up displaying the raw value rather than the resolved one,
				which wasn't my intention.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Data File Updates</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added Alchemical Formulas, Ointments, Pastilles, Potions &amp;
				Powders, contributed by Kevin Michael Smith.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.3 &mdash; February 5, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added another string comparison type, "is anything", to allow
				a particular field to always match.</li>
			<li>Added support for modifying the Size Modifier via a Feature.
				Updated the Dwarfism and Gigantism (dis)advantages
				appropriately, as well as the Dwarf racial template.</li>
			<li>Advantage containers can now act in one of three ways:
				<ol>
					<li>Group (works as it used to, and is the default)</li>
					<li>Meta-Trait (acts as one normal trait, listed as an
						advantage if its point total is positive, or a
						disadvantage if it is negative)</li>
					<li>Race (point cost tracked separately from normal
						advantages and disadvantages)</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Added support for specifying a tech level for a spell. Updated
				the various Technology College spells that required a TL.</li>
			<li>The total carried weight is now shown in parentheses next to
				the "Carried Equipment" title.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Altering basic lift (via Strength, for example) will now cause
				the current encumbrance level highlight to change, if needed.</li>
			<li>Used the new "is anything" match type to fix the inability to
				correctly match when the notes field wasn't important.</li>
			<li>The title of the weapons section is now titled "Weapons" rather
				than the generic "Description".</li>
			<li>The "equipped" state of equipment no longer affects your
				character's encumbrance or whether the item will show up in the
				weapon list. It now only affects whether features of the
				equipment (such as a ring that gives +1 to ST) are applied to
				the character, as originally intended.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.2 &mdash; January 29, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added support for creating skill prerequisites that can make a
				decision based on the skill specialization.</li>
			<li>Added support for creating (dis)advantage prerequisites that can
				make a decision based on its notes (required for most language
				prerequisites, since I store the spoken/written info in notes).</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Prerequisites that require an advantage be present at level 0 or
				better will now work again for advantages that don't have levels.</li>
			<li>Print settings in locales where the number format isn't the same
				as the U.S. number format should no longer fail to load
				correctly.</li>
			<li>Fixed the prerequisites in the "Firearms" equipment list to use
				specializations.</li>
			<li>Fixed various language-based skills and spells to use the new
				support for looking into notes to determine whether the
				language is sufficient as a prereq.  In at least one case, I
				still need to provide a way to check for X languages, which is
				not currently supported.</li>
			<li>Some text was not using my dynamic font code, which meant the
				user was unable to change it... fixed.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Miscellaneous</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>The defaults, prerequisites and features tabs are now more
				vertically oriented.</li>
			<li>Transitioned from roleplayer.com to trollworks.com, as I will
				likely be selling the roleplayer.com domain in the near future.</li>
			<li>New splash screen/about box.</li>
			<li>Moved all of the html files into a documentation folder.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.1.0.1 &mdash; January 22, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>The nameable feature (where you can embed @foo@ in a name to
				have the user prompted to type some text to replace it when it
				is placed into a sheet) now extends into most (if not all) text
				fields of (Dis)Advantages, Skills, Spells & Equipment. In
				addition, if you use the same name in more than one place, it
				will only be prompted for once and substituted into all
				occurrences.</li>
			<li>Removed the ability to directly edit fields within the lists
				&mdash; you must now bring up the detailed editor to make
				changes. The detailed editors are now capable of editing all
				information for the item.</li>
			<li>Provided a separate field for specializations.</li>
			<li>Provided a separate field for notes for all list types.</li>
			<li>New column layout for most items.</li>
			<li>Added a first pass at a user's manual by Brad Rice. Please be
				sure to give him some feedback.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>While I haven't experienced this myself, some users were
				reporting either a failure to load saved sheets, or the sheet
				being <b>huge</b> (as if the paper were dozens of feet across).
				The only thing in common with these folks seemed to be inkjet
				printers (although I may have missed a laser printer in a bug
				report). Anyway, I've added code that is much more careful about
				trying to restore printer settings that the printer originally
				reported as being able to support &mdash; I suspect these
				printers were reporting some feature as being available, but
				would then error out when I tried to restore that setting.
				Should this happen in this release, the code ignores the error
				and proceeds with the next setting. This should prevent the
				huge/no paper size from occuring, as I don't think it was ever
				getting that far before failing. Those of you experiencing
				the problem, please send me a quick email to let me know if
				this fixes your problem, as I have no way to test for it.</li>
			<li>When a file failed to save, there was generally no feedback to
				the user. Now, if a file fails to save for any reason, a dialog
				box will be put up to warn the user.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Miscellaneous</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Firearms, High-Tech &amp; Ultra-Tech Armor added, courtesy of
				Karl Gunnarsson.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.0.0.25 &mdash; January 2, 2006</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>When launching the program, you now get a file dialog so that
				you can choose to open an existing file, or create a new window.</li>
			<li>Implemented a complete replacement for the Sun page setup and
				print dialogs, along with all the logic that is associated with
				them. What this means for the end user is that all settings
				(that I can get to, which I think are most of them) are equally
				available on all platforms and presented to the end user in the
				same way. In addition, it allowed me to fix a whole host of bugs
				that Sun's three(!) different implementations had. As a
				side-effect, I've removed the preference that would show the
				minimum printer margins on the displayed character sheet --
				there was no reliable way to get this data from within Java on
				anything other than Windows, so I didn't think it was worth
				keeping. For those that liked it the way it was, you can still
				use the native page setup/print dialogs by choosing to do so in
				preferences. If you do so, be aware that most of the print
				settings in the native dialogs cannot be saved and restored, so
				you'll have to manually set them up every time you want to
				print, just like in previous versions of GCS.</li>
			<li>Spells in templates now allow points to be specified.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed an infinite loop in the layout engine in the case where a
				cell within a row had so much data that it could not possibly
				fit on a single page. If this case occurs, I now just display
				as much as possible of that row and move on.</li>
			<li>Newly created character sheets and saved character sheets that
				you've opened but made no changes to are no longer marked as
				modified until you actually make a change.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rheader>Miscellaneous</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added an equipment list for Powerstones, in 1 point increments
				all the way up to 300 points.  The value numbers exactly match
				those on M20, and the ones that aren't listed on that page were
				generated using their formula for cost, then applying a scaled
				rounding similar to what the book did.</li>
			<li>Fixed some typos in some of the data files, added some entries
				that were missing, and cleaned up some entries.</li>
			<li>Added some more templates.</li>
			<li>Added the command key SHIFT-CMD-P to the Page Setup menu item.</li>
			<li>The duplicate command now tries to insert the duplicate next to
				the original (previously, it would put it at the end of the
				list).</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.0.0.24 &mdash; December 28, 2005</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the Duplicate command for easily duplicating rows in
				lists.</li>
			<li>Templates now contain a notes field, which will be appended to
				any existing notes on a character sheet when the template is
				applied.</li>
			<li>The detailed editors now remember the last tab that was selected
				and attempt to restore that tab when you open the next editor.</li>

			<li>Spent a lot of time trying to divine just how the Sun code is
				diverting keyboard focus, causing annoying scroll jumps, poor

			<li>Skull DR now includes the 2 points you get naturally.</li>
			<li>Fixed the menu item "Open Detail Editor" so that it is enabled

			<li>Fixed a problem where drag &amp; drop would occassionally fail,

			<li>Re-opening a sheet that had carried equipment now does an

			<li>The Vitals hit location now tracks with the Torso.  Previously,
				it was separate, yet there was no longer any way to armor that
				spot.</li>
			<li>Reinstated the Defaults editor for equipment and
				(dis)advantages, as weapons need to be able to specify what
				skills they default from.</li>
			<li>The "Equipped" flag, while able to be manipulated while the
				character sheet was open, was never saved out (it was always set
				to "yes" on saved equipment).  Fixed.</li>

			<li>Revised the skill default and free point calculation code to

				Talents.</li>
			<li>Allow basic speed to be altered in fractional units via
				Features.</li>
			<li>Fixed a problem that prevented the page setting for orientation
				from being read back in correctly (it always ended up in
				portrait mode, regardless of the actual setting).</li>
			<li>Fixed a problem that prevented bonuses to HP and FP from being
				displayed.</li>
			<li>Revised all of the number handling code to try and deal with
				differences between formatted numbers in different
				localizations. Specifically, things like commas and periods are
				treated differently.  This was dealt with in the user interface
				previously, but not in the file format, which led to oddities
				when using a numeric style that didn't match mine.  Non-U.S.
				users will have to tell me whether I got this right... and,
				hopefully, I didn't break anything new in the process.</li>

			<li>Added support for wildcard skills. The difficulty of "W" is
				used to denote these skills.</li>
			<li>Added the 4 wildcard skills listed in the basic set and updated
				the various melee weapons affected by the Sword! skill.</li>
			<li>Added a menu option for adding to the top template, similar to

			<li>Added a menu item for opening the detail editors.</li>

			<li>Added a menu item to force the cursor into the search field.</li>
			<li>The equipment Quantity field and skill/spell Points fields now
				support +/- for increment/decrement, as well as the scroll wheel
				(just like the Level field for advantages).</li>
			<li>Those fields that respond to +/- now also respond to the = key,
				as that's just the unshifted version of the +.</li>
			<li>Added automatic generation of the "Punch", "Kick", and

			<li>Added some more low tech armor entries, contributed by Patrick
				O'Neil.</li>
			<li>Spells with a difficulty of Very Hard no longer require their
				name to end with "(VH)". Instead, there is a checkbox in the
				detailed editor for setting this attribute. Old data will be
				transparently upgraded to the new format, with the trailing
				"(VH)" removed.</li>
			<li>Added support for non-standard tech levels, such as "4+1".</li>
			<li>Added a notes field. Until I have a chance to write a robust
				editor that can deal with multiple views onto the same backing
				content, you'll have to double-click the notes area to bring up
				a simple editor to make changes. Not ideal, I know, but the
				alternative was to go without... for a potentially long time.</li>

			<li>When the new random name generation was put in, I inadverantly
				disabled the ability to re-randomize the various description
				fields (the menu item was always disabled). Corrected this.</li>
			<li>Now that Very Hard spells no longer need special naming, the
				prequisites that relied on exact name matches are working again
				for Very Hard spells.</li>
			<li>Rewrote many of the underlying text drawing classes to ensure
				better consistency between various UI pieces and how they draw
				and measure text. This should eliminate many of the one pixel

			<li>New character sheets now generate a random name for the
				character, much like the various other description fields are

			<li>Added two new menu items for randomly generating male and
				female names. The names are based on the 1990 U.S. census data,
				so they may or may not be appropriate for your particular
				character.</li>
			<li>Page setup settings are now preserved with the character
				sheet. In addition, although the default margins are set to a
				half inch on each side, altering them in the page setup dialog
				will now alter them on the sheet. This particular functionality
				seems to be partially broken on Mac OS X, as the standard
				dialog doesn't have a place to enter margins. I may have to
				resort to building my own page setup dialogs in the future...</li>
			<li>Added a checkbox in the Sheet preferences that controls whether
				a light blue line is shown on the character sheet where the
				minimum margins for your current printer are. This particular
				functionality doesn't seem to work quite right on both Linux and
				Mac OS X... not sure what, if anything, can be done to correct

			<li>Changed the version number scheme to
				[major].[minor].[bugfix].[build] instead of the old
				[major].[minor].[bugfix][alpha/beta[build]].</li>

				<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html">download
				and install Java 1.5 from here</a>. Once Apple starts including
				this in the OS, like they do with versions 1.3 and 1.4, this

			<li>All list data types (advantages, skills, equipment) now have a
				"defaults" list associated with them (editable from the detail

			<li>The weapon parry display now attempts to resolve the current Parry

			<li>The weapon display now shows the skill level at which the character

		<ul>
			<li>Fixed image loading on Mac OS X 10.4 ("Tiger") -- there is a bug in
				the ImageIO package in that version of the OS that is causing the
				red and blue channels to be swapped.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p class=rversion>Version 3.0.0.10 &mdash; May 1, 2005</p>
	<p class=rheader>Features</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Skill defaults are now supported. I'm not sure I got this exactly
				right... although I'm not sure I can get it more "right" than it is
				currently.</li>
			<li>Support new DR locations: eyes, vitals, full body, full body except
				eyes.</li>
			<li>The checkmark columns now display a checkmark or a blank rather than
				a Y or N. In addition, they respond to single mouse clicks in
				addition to the keyboard (Y, y, N, n, or space to toggle). This may
				be disconcerting if you have a row selected and accidentally hit the
				checkbox area, as the checkbox will respond and the row will lose
				its selection. Also, the effect, if any, of the checkmark being on
				or off will show up immediately, unlike before, where it would wait
				until you left the field. Let me know how this feels...</li>
			<li>I now process all nameable "@foo@" directives I find in the nameable
				section of a row, rather than just the first as in the previous
				release.</li>
		</ul>

	<p class=rheader>Bug Fixes</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Editing a row with the detailed editor dialog will now always
				mark the data file as modified.</li>
			<li>Drag &amp; drop of rows to an Equipment, Skill, or Spell list in
				the sheet now process nameable "@foo@" directives.</li>

	<p class=rheader>Miscellaneous</p>
	<div class=indent>
		<ul>
			<li>Incorporated Charles' updates to various lists. While I was at it,
				rearranged the Lists folder.</li>
			<li>Added a folder icon to the sub-menus presented in the Lists menu.</li>
			<li>Tweaked the splash screen some more.</li>
